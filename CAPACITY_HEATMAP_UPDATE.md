# Capacity HeatMap Enhancement - Using JIRA Users

## 🎯 Objective
Modified the Capacity HeatMap to use the same users from JIRA data instead of hardcoded static users.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure Update (`src/web/index.html`)
- **Removed**: Static hardcoded heatmap grid with users like "John Doe", "Jane Smith", etc.
- **Added**: Dynamic `.capacity-heatmap` container that gets populated by JavaScript
- **Kept**: Legend and controls for better user experience
- **Updated**: Legend ranges to match the new utilization thresholds (0-60%, 60-80%, 80-100%)

### 2. JavaScript Enhancement (`src/web/integration.js`)
- **Enhanced**: `renderCapacityHeatmap()` function with comprehensive team capacity visualization
- **Added**: New helper methods:
  - `getUtilizationClass()` - Returns CSS class based on utilization level
  - `getUtilizationStatus()` - Returns status text with emojis
- **Features**: 
  - Shows real JIRA user data (Stacey, Maya, Supraja)
  - Displays key skills for each team member
  - Shows current load, capacity, and utilization
  - Includes team summary with total capacity and utilization
  - Responsive design for mobile devices

### 3. CSS Styling (`src/web/styles.css`)
- **Added**: Comprehensive styling for the enhanced capacity heatmap
- **Features**:
  - Grid-based layout for better organization
  - Color-coded utilization levels (Green/Orange/Red)
  - Professional card-based design
  - Responsive breakpoints for mobile
  - Team summary section with statistics

## 🔄 Dynamic Data Integration

The capacity heatmap now:
1. **Loads from JIRA data**: Uses the same `mock_jira_users.json` file as the task recommendations
2. **Updates automatically**: When users are assigned tasks, their capacity updates in real-time
3. **Shows API status**: Indicates whether using Mock or Real JIRA data
4. **Responsive to changes**: Reflects any modifications to user capacity or skills

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

- **Grid Layout**: Clean, organized display of team information
- **Skill Display**: Shows top 3 skills with levels for each team member
- **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of current load vs capacity
- **Color Coding**: 
  - 🟢 Green (0-60%): Available
  - 🟠 Orange (60-80%): Busy  
  - 🔴 Red (80-100%): Overloaded
- **Team Summary**: Overall team statistics and utilization

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Same user data across all features (recommendations + capacity)
2. **Real-time Updates**: Capacity changes when tasks are assigned
3. **Better Insights**: More detailed information about team members
4. **Professional UI**: Enhanced visual design and user experience
5. **Responsive**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices

## 🧪 Testing

To test the enhanced capacity heatmap:
1. Start the web server: `cd src/web && python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Click on "📊 Capacity Heatmap" tab
4. Verify that Stacey, Maya, and Supraja are displayed with their JIRA data
5. Assign some tasks and see the capacity update in real-time

## 📝 Next Steps

- The capacity heatmap now seamlessly integrates with the JIRA user data
- All team members shown in recommendations will also appear in the capacity view
- Future enhancements could include historical capacity trends and sprint planning features
