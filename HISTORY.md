    - Changed from `window.location.href = 'src/web/index.html'` to use root router
    - Fixed both login success and existing session redirection paths
    - Updated session storage keys for consistency

  - **`auth.js`** - Fixed relative path issues:
    - Updated logout redirection to `../../login.html` (from src/web/ back to root)
    - Fixed session cleanup paths to work from nested directory structure
    - Corrected all localStorage/sessionStorage references

  - **`src/web/index.html`** - Fixed auth.js import:
    - Changed from `<script src="auth.js"></script>` to `<script src="../../auth.js"></script>`
    - Ensured proper authentication middleware loading

  **Solution Implemented**:
  - **Created `index.html`** (1,505 bytes) at root level as router:
    - Acts as intermediary redirect page with loading animation
    - Automatically redirects to `src/web/index.html` after 1 second
    - Provides smooth user experience with "üöÄ TaskFlow" branding
    - Simplifies all redirection logic throughout the application

  **Created Documentation**:
  - **`REDIRECTION_FIX.md`** (4,297 bytes) - Complete fix documentation:
    - Detailed problem analysis and root cause identification
    - Step-by-step solution implementation
    - File structure explanation and path corrections
    - Testing procedures and validation steps
    - Benefits of the router-based solution

  **Flow After Fix**:
  1. **Login Flow**: `login.html` ‚Üí successful auth ‚Üí `index.html` (router) ‚Üí `src/web/index.html`
  2. **Logout Flow**: Main app ‚Üí auth middleware ‚Üí `../../login.html`
  3. **Direct Access**: `src/web/index.html` ‚Üí auth check ‚Üí redirect if needed

  **Benefits Achieved**:
  - ‚úÖ **Working Redirections**: All page navigation now functions correctly
  - ‚úÖ **Seamless UX**: Smooth transitions between login and main application
  - ‚úÖ **Proper Authentication**: Session protection works across all pages
  - ‚úÖ **Maintainable Code**: Clean, consistent path handling throughout
